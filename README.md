**Title:**

Arbitrage and trading in financial markets

**Abstract:**

The paper “Arbitrage concepts under trading restrictions in discrete-time financial markets”
explores relationships between concepts of arbitrage and trading strategies in a financial
market with risky and risk-free assets in discrete time.<sup>1</sup> Expanding on the notion of classical
no-arbitrage, this paper characterizes trading strategies under no-arbitrage of the first kind.
In both one-period and multi-period markets, this paper shows that no-arbitrage of the
first kind allows for the existence of an optimal trading strategy, numeraire portfolio, and a
risk-neutral measure, three key concepts in financial markets and trading. In our report, we
present in detail the proofs of existence for the three concepts named above in the one-period
setting of the paper’s model.
